# Experiment for unifying physical theories

I would like to write to inform you of a possible idea that has occurred to me.
 
I believe (but take it with a grain of salt) that it might be possible to perform an experiment with a quantum computer to simulate a physical phenomenon in which an AI should be the observer.
 
I know that quantum computers, in addition to being computers in the strict sense of the word, allow quantum experiments to be performed based on the technology with which they are built.
 
If we could have an AI observing a physical phenomenon, the AI itself would be the observer of the experiment.
 
The AI would have to be purpose-built, I think. I don't know if it could be a common LLM (or more advanced language models), however, it will be necessary to be able to “read its brain” (I assume some kind of “telemetry” for Agents).

A possible experiment should express in a software with quantum language (as Microsoft Q#) to simulate a physical phenomenon; in my opinion, the code should be recursive (the code maybe wrong; take only the questions).
